PyEXOAnalysis (short name 'pyexo') are a set of python
bindings for the EXO Offline Analysis package.  A more
complete user reference manual will be completed soon.


PyEXOAnalysis is built and installed using the familiar python
distutils.  To perform a build, please do the following:

python setup.py build

To install:

python setup.py install [--home=[dir/to/install/python/modules]

where the 'home' parameter allows distutils to install into
a particular location.  This is particular useful when
installing 'local' python packages when the user does not
have the appropriate permissions to perform a system-wide
install.  If this option is used, be sure that the directory
specified in the passed-in flag is in the list defined
in the environment variable PYTHONPATH.
