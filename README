PyEXOAnalysis (short name 'pyexo') are a set of python
bindings for the EXO Offline Analysis package.  A more
complete user reference manual will be completed soon.

I. Installation Instructions

PyEXOAnalysis is built and installed using the familiar python
distutils.  

I.1 Build

  To perform a build, please do the following:

python setup.py build [--swig=/u/xo/mgmarino/software/bin/swig]

  On SLAC machines, please append the last flag (without the 
  brackets).  The current included distribution of swig on the
  SLAC computers is too old and this will use the one in my 
  directory.  Perhaps in the future, this will
  automatically be added to the EXO software path to ensure
  this step is avoided. 

I.2

  To install:

python setup.py install [--home=/dir/to/install/python/modules]


  where the 'home' parameter allows distutils to install into
  a particular location.  This is particular useful when
  installing 'local' python packages when the user does not
  have the appropriate permissions to perform a system-wide
  install.  
  
  If this option is used, be sure that the directory
  specified in the passed-in flag is in the list defined
  in the environment variable PYTHONPATH.  For example,
  if '/my/python/directory' is specified with the --home
  flag, be sure to add '/my/python/directory/lib/python' 
  to your PYTHONPATH variable.
